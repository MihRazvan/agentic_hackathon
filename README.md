## Overview

In the complex world of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), participants face several critical challenges:

- **Information Overload:** Navigating through multiple DAOs and their numerous proposals can be overwhelming.
- **Complex Proposal Analysis:** Understanding the implications of various proposals requires significant effort.
- **Time-Consuming Participation:** Active involvement in governance processes demands substantial time and attention (usually not directly compensated).
- **Fragmented Tools and Data:** The lack of unified platform leads to inefficiencies and missed opportunities.

**TABULA** addresses these challenges by providing an intelligent, unified dashboard that transforms how users engage with DAOs. With our approach, we transmute raw governance data into clear, actionable insights.
